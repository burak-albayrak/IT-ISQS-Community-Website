## About The Project

IT-ISQS (Innovative Training for International Software Quality Standards) is an Erasmus+ funded project (Programme Action Type: KA220-HED) aimed at enhancing awareness and understanding of international software quality standards (ISQS) in the IT sector. The project addresses the critical gap in software quality standards education and implementation in today's digital era.

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s fast-paced IT landscape, software quality is more important than ever. Yet:

- Only **31%** of software projects are fully successful.
- Many fail due to **budget overruns**, **delays**, and **low customer satisfaction**.
- There is a **lack of awareness and understanding** of ISO/IEC software quality standards.
- Most **university curricula** do not include comprehensive training on these standards.

The IT-ISQS project directly addresses these gaps.
