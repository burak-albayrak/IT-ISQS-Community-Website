## About The Project

IT-ISQS (Innovative Training for International Software Quality Standards) is an Erasmus+ funded project (Programme Action Type: KA220-HED) aimed at enhancing awareness and understanding of international software quality standards (ISQS) in the IT sector. The project addresses the critical gap in software quality standards education and implementation in today's digital era.
